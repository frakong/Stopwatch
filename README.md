# Stopwatch
Stopwatch program written in Javascript.
When you run this program, there will be a "Start" button to start the timer, a "Pause" button to pause the timer, and a "Reset" button to set it back to 0.
If you press the "Reset" button while the timer is running, the timer will stop and reset itself back to 0.
